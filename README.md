Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


After installing the dependencies, run the file finalProject.ipynb to generate the first two models talked about.

The second two files are contained in torchFinalProject.ipynb. The first model in this file is the ResNet model, and the second is the last custom model. Both are trained using PyTorch instead of TensorFlow.

The code will also generate some images and comparison metrics we used in our presentation and report.
